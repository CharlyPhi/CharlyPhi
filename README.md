### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Charly I am French and recently transitioned from sales to web development.
My first noticeable achievement is the 2 months bootcamp from Le Wagon I finished on the 19th of september 2022 but you can also check my side projects or offer me a job :) !
I am currently continuing to learn Ruby on rails, Javascript and CSS and would ideally work with those languages but I also started working on React a few months ago and would be interested in using that again.
